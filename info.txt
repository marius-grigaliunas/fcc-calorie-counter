Started to modify the project.

    to do:
    -comments
    -refactoring
    
    done:
    -Calendar added. Took about 3 hours to experiment and generate a 
    dynamic grid calendar. I gained more experience working with dates and
    general algorithmic thinking. The hardest problem was generating last month's 
    dates on the calendar, the calculations to get the previous dates took time to
    think of, but overall I don't think this was challenging.
    -added localStorage saving and retrieving.
    -displaying localStorage data on the calendar.
    -clearing localStorage
    -switching days
    -more responsive calendar design
